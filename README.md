# APIAutomation

This repo contains API automationn demo. I have used following resources for this.

Prerequistes:
1. Python 3
2. Python's request module

We will be covering various http methods involved in API testing.

Installtion:
1. Install python from "python.org/downloads/" as per your system requirement
   try to use the latest version.
2. Once python is installed and configured use pip(python's package manager) 
   to install request module if not already installed.
   
   pip install requests

3. We are using "https://reqres.in/" ,this website consists of basic CRUD
   operation methods and other details on how to use them.

All the http methods can be found inside the HTTP_Methods folder
This directory contains
> GET
> POST
> PUT
> PATCH
> DELETE

we will be covering how to do all these operations and verify their results.
